<h1>My Cat Alice</h1>
<p>My cat Alice is the true queen of our home. She is a British Shorthair, and her fluffy fur and round eyes always attract attention. Alice is no longer young; she’s getting old, but she remains as gentle and affectionate as she was in her youth. Her favorite activity is long hours of resting on the soft bed, where she purrs with pleasure.</p>

<p class="my">Despite her age, Alice hasn’t lost her curiosity about the world around her. She loves sitting on the windowsill, watching the birds and cars outside. Her presence in the house adds coziness and warmth, and when she gently curls up in my lap, the whole world seems perfect.</p>

<p class="my" id="alice">Although Alice is no longer as active as she once was, her purring and gaze are always able to lift my spirits. She is a true friend and a member of the family, and I am very grateful for every moment we spend together.</p>
